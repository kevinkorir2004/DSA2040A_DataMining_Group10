### 🎯 Project Overview
Chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease pose major public health challenges. This project aims to **identify key demographic and lifestyle factors that influence an individual's risk of developing chronic illness**. By using synthetic health data that reflects real-world patterns, the project seeks to extract meaningful insights and predictive patterns using data mining techniques.

---

### ❓ Key Questions
- What are the most significant lifestyle and demographic contributors to chronic illness risk?
- Can individuals be grouped into risk segments using clustering?
- How accurately can we predict illness risk based on selected features?

### 🛠️ Proposed Methods and Techniques

- **ETL Pipeline**: Synthetic dataset generation → Cleaning → BMI computation → Encoding
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Statistical distributions, group comparisons, correlation analysis
- **Data Mining**:
  - **Classification**: Logistic regression, decision trees
  - **Clustering**: K-means to segment population into risk clusters
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts for dashboard and reporting

---

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Dashboarding**: Jupyter Dash or Plotly Dash
- **Version Control**: GitHub
